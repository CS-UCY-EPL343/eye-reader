# Mobile App
A Mobile App developed using web technologies, such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, which are compiled to hybrid mobile app using the the Corvova toolset, which wraps our HTML/JavaScript app into a native container which can access the device functions of several platforms. These functions are exposed via a unified JavaScript API, allowing us to easily write one set of code to target nearly every phone or tablet on the market today and publish to their app stores.

## How to Get Started

2) Install Android Studio  
3) Install Cordova  
4) Build for android using cordova CLI

### Install Android Studio
- Navigate to [Android Studio's Homepage](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and download the latest installer for your system (e.g. Android Studio  3.0.1 for Windows)

```
$ cordova create EyeReader
```

- Now you have to navigate to EyeReader folder and find a folder named 'www'. Delete everything inside the folder 'www' and copy all the contets of Mobile_App directory of this repository.

- After creating a Cordova project and replacing the contents of the 'www' folder, navigate to the project directory. From the project directory, you need to add a platform for which you want to build your app.

 To add a platform, type cordova platform add <platform name>.

 For a complete list of platforms you can add, run cordova platform.  
```
$ cd EyeReader
```  
```
$ cordova platform add android
```

- To build for a specific platform, type cordova build <platform name>.  
```
$ cordova build android
```

- If the build process finishes successfully, the .apk file will be located inside  
```
/EyeReader/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk
```
